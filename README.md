# .mmbak Viewer Online
Simple online viewer to navigate through the content of a mmbak file.

It uses the PHP library [mmbak viewer](https://github.com/ricci69/mmbak-viewer/), an open source project.

mmbak files are the backup of [Money Manager APP](https://realbyteapps.com/) (a wonderful personal finance app that I recommend you try).
